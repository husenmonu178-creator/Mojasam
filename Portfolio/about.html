    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">
        I am a creative designer specializing in graphic design, 
        logo design, video editing, photo editing, and Whiteboard animation.
        I enjoy creating clean, modern, and meaningful designs and funny memes that
        leave a strong impression.

        My name is MD Sheikh Mojasam Husain. Currently, I am studying as a student in Shree Trivuwan
        Shanti Secondary School. Despite of being in secondary level I have gained a little more skils in 
        Web Developing, Video Editing, Photo Editing, Graphic Designing and Whiteboard Animation.
        You can contact me on Facebook, Threads or via E-mail, which you will find in "CONTACT" page through Nav Bar.
